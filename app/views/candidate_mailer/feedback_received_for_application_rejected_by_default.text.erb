Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Feedback on your application

Your application for <%= @course.name_and_code %> was automatically rejected on <%= @application_choice.rejected_at.to_s(:govuk_date) %>.

This was because <%= @course.provider.name %> did not respond in time. Theyâ€™ve now given you the following feedback:

<% if FeatureFlag.active?(:structured_reasons_for_rejection_on_rbd) %>
  <%= render 'reasons_for_rejection' %>
<% else %>
  ^<%= @application_choice.rejection_reason&.gsub(/\n/,"\n^") %>
<% end %>
